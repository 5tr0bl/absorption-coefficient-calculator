This software is a tool for calculating the absorption coefficient of different types of absorbers. The goal of this tool is to enable anyone to quickly calculate the absorption coefficient for different frequencies, either for one material or multilayered materials.

---
The repository was forked for deployment reasons and therefore exists at two different locations.
